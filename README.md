# MealTracker

A project that keeps track of the user's day-to-day food consumption.

Utilizes the USDA's "FoodData Central" API to search for food and retrieve nutritional values, and as such uses an API key. To setup locally, I suggest checking one out yourself (allowing for a generous 3500 calls/day)! More info at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/.

Also utilizes Python's standard pickle library to serialize/deserialize my custom classes for storage purposes.

Still being worked on, so rough at the edges. Included is my command-line interface implementation, and I am working on a GUI-driven implementation using Tkinter.
